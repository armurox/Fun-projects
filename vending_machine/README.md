This is a fun project I saw from the homework section of the Johns Hopkins Intermediate Programming summer course, set as a homework 1 for students. The aim is to code up a simplified vending machine, with three items, cola, a candy bar and popcorn. The vending machine's job is to calculate the change due to the student when they request an item. I aim to perhaps extend this project more than the specifications.
